This program is to compute the topic similarity of two models.

************* Compiling *************

From a terminal, type:
g++ Sources/comparison.cpp -O3 -o compare_models -Wall


************* Input *************

The program requires two "theta files" as "syn_thetas.txt" generated by 

python ../synthetic_corpuses/synthetic_datasets/syn_from_languages.py
or 
python ../synthetic_corpuses/synthetic_datasets/syn_corpus_alpha.py 

LDA (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/lda-c/index.html) provides the same kind of file (final.gamma) as well as TopicMapping (lda_gammas_final.txt).

The program also requires the corpus file in text format: each line is a document.

************* Output *************

The program prints to screen the best match similarity.
Since the similarity is compared to a null model, there might be some small fluctuations.

1. eff1 and eff2 are the effective number of topics in the two models
2. raw is the "raw" similarity, before comparing it to the null model (random).
3. bm similarity is the final outcome.


************* Example *************

1. Create a synthetic dataset:
python ../synthetic_corpuses/synthetic_datasets/syn_corpus_alpha.py 1e-3 0.3 0.2

2. Run TopicMapping:
../../bin/topicmap -f syn_corpus.txt -o test

3. Compare:
./compare_models test/lda_gammas_final.txt syn_thetas.txt syn_corpus.txt

If you do not have TopicMapping, you might just try to compare the model with itself.
./compare_models syn_thetas.txt syn_thetas.txt syn_corpus.txt
